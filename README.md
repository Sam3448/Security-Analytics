Coded by Weicheng Zhang.

## Introduction
This is the course project for Security Analytics, Fall 2017.

Homework 1: using Numpy, Pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn to decribe a csv chart.
Homework 2: using Pandas, matplotlib, subprocess, numpy to describe data from a TCP flow data file (.pcap), which is got by using WIRESHARK and output file using Tcpflow.
Homework 3: using decision tree and logistic model regression model to classify large data and see the accuracy of classification. Also I use information gain and entropy to screen all feature and get ten feature with most information of the data.
